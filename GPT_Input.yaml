# This is a prompt GPT made for itself in terms of DMP and NIH generation
Generate a Data Management Plan (DMP) for a research project following the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. 
Assume the project involves [briefly describe the research topic, e.g., a study on [specific disease or health-related issue]]. 
The DMP should adhere to NIH requirements and cover key aspects such as data types, collection methods, documentation, storage, 
security, sharing, long-term preservation, and compliance.

---
Include specific details such as the types of data to be collected, formats used, 
instruments for data collection, metadata standards, storage locations, backup procedures, 
data security measures, plans for data sharing, repositories for data sharing, long-term preservation strategies, 
roles and responsibilities for data management, and compliance with ethical and legal considerations.

---
Ensure that the generated DMP is comprehensive and aligns with the latest NIH recommendations. 
If there are any specific NIH updates or nuances, incorporate them into the plan.
