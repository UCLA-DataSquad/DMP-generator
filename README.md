# Files

There are two types of files, examples and input files. The example files are named LLM_examples.ipynb. These files contains
examples prompts given to the LLM and their output. The input files are named LLM_Input.yaml. These files have key-value pairing along with a prompt
that you will feed to their respective LLM.

## Example Files:

Example files have the following format. Each example will start with an Example name in heading 1 style. Then there will be an Input and Output subheading. 

The Input subheading will be the exact prompt that you fed into the LLM. You can copy and past it from your input.

The Output subheading contains the output that the LLM gave in response to your input.

## Input Files:

Copy the yaml file, fill in the required forms, if you don't have anything to fill then just take that portion out of the file. After filling in all the
required details, copy and paste the file contents to its respective LLM. 

***REMEMBER TO DELETE THE EXAMPLES BEFORE INPUTTING IT INTO THE LLM!!! IF YOU FORGET TO DO THIS YOU WILL CONFUSE IT!***
