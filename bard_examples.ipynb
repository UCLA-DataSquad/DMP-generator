    "Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) is a commensal bacterium commonly found on human skin. However, it can also be a significant opportunistic pathogen, particularly in the context of indwelling medical devices. Over a million people are estimated to be infected through such devices each year, leading to substantial healthcare costs and increased mortality. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods often lack specificity, leading to misidentification of C. acnes and inappropriate antibiotic use.
